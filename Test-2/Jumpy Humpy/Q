Jumpy Humpy Humpy likes to jump from one building to another. But he only jumps to next higher building and stops when no higher building is available. Stamina required for a journey is xor of all the heights on which humpy jumps until he stops. If heights are [1 2 4], and he starts from 1, goes to 2 stamina required is 1 ⊕ 2 = 3 , then from 2 to 3. Stamina for the entire journey is 1 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 4 = 7 . Find the maximum stamina required if can start his journey from any building. Input First line: , no of buildings. Second line: integers, defining heights of buildings. Output Single Integer that is the maximum stamina required for any journey. Constraints 1 ≤ ≤ 10 5 1 ≤ ℎ ≤ 10 9 Sample input 5 1 2 3 8 6 Sample output 11 Explanation If he starts from building 1, the stamina required is 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 8 = 8 From the building 2, the stamina required is 2 ^ 3 ^ 8 = 9 From the building 3, the stamina required is 3 ^ 8 = 11 Similarly, from 8 and 6, stamina required are 8 and 6 respectively. The maximum stamina required for the journey is from building 3 is 11. So the answer is 11. The following test cases are the actual test cases of this question that may be used to evaluate your submission. Sample input 1 25 5 Sample output 1 5 Sample input 2 51 2 3 2 3 Sample output 2 3 Note: Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.
